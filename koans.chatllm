When I create an instance of the proxy, which I'll call tv, I would like for the attributes of the proxied target_object to be available, generically. That is, I do not want a specific method in the proxy for each attribute in target_object. How would I do this in python? Would I use getattr or getattribute?",

      "value": "In Python, you can use the `__getattr__` method to make the attributes of the proxied `target_object` available generically. The `__getattr__` method is a special method that's called when an attribute lookup does not find the attribute in the object's instance dictionary.\n\nHere's how you could implement this in the `Proxy` class:\n\n```python\nclass Proxy:\n    def __init__(self, target_object):\n        self._obj = target_object\n\n    def __getattr__(self, attr):\n        return getattr(self._obj, attr)\n```\n\nIn this code, if you try to access an attribute on an instance of `Proxy` that doesn't exist on the `Proxy` instance itself, Python will call the `__getattr__` method. This method then delegates the attribute lookup to the `target_object` by calling `getattr(self._obj, attr)`.\n\nNote that `__getattribute__` is another special method that's called for every attribute lookup, whether the attribute exists or not. It's more powerful but also more dangerous because it can easily lead to infinite recursion if not used carefully. In most cases, `__getattr__` is the better choice for implementing a proxy.",
